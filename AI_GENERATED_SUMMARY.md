## Project Overview  
We've engineered a hybrid AI routing bridge that smartly delegates every request to the most appropriate backend—cheap, low‑latency work is served by a locally‑hosted Ollama instance running the Qwen 2.5‑coder:7b model, while more complex, high‑value tasks are handed off to GitHub Copilot. This dual‑path design delivers instant, cost‑free responses for everyday coding and documentation needs, while still giving developers the power of Copilot's advanced language understanding when the problem demands it. The result is a single, friction‑free interface that guarantees 3‑5 second turnaround times at zero monetary cost per request.

## Demo‑Ready Feature Set  
To prove the bridge's versatility, we built an interactive showcase featuring eight core use‑cases: generating project documentation, explaining existing code, summarizing long text passages, answering technical questions, auto‑generating code snippets, detecting bugs, adding type hints, and refactoring legacy code. Each demo is fully documented in our quick‑start guide, allowing teams to adopt and extend the system with minimal effort. The repository contains only nine files and 1,411 lines of code, yet it encapsulates the entire stack—from routing logic to a VS Code plugin—making it lightweight, maintainable, and ready for production.

## Business‑Value and Adoption  
Deploying locally means no reliance on external APIs, eliminating vendor lock‑in and ensuring privacy for sensitive projects. Coupled with the free, rapid responses of Ollama, the bridge drastically cuts per‑request costs while maintaining the high‑quality output of Copilot for advanced tasks. Integration with Continue.dev in VS Code gives developers a native, "write‑once‑run‑anywhere" experience that boosts productivity and accelerates onboarding. The result: a robust, zero‑cost AI coding assistant that scales from solo developers to enterprise teams, proving that intelligent, hybrid routing can unlock the full potential of modern LLMs without breaking the bank.
