# Continue.dev Cleanup Guide

## What to Remove

### 1. VS Code Extension (Optional)
If you want to fully remove Continue.dev from VS Code:

```bash
# List installed extensions
code --list-extensions | grep continue

# Uninstall if present
code --uninstall-extension continue.continue
```

### 2. Config Directory (Optional)
The Continue.dev config is in `~/.continue/`:

```bash
# Backup first (for historical reference)
mv ~/.continue ~/.continue.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Or delete entirely
# rm -rf ~/.continue
```

### 3. Project References
Continue.dev is only referenced in:
- `smoke-test-phase/` - Historical artifacts (KEEP for proof-of-concept)
- No production code references Continue.dev

## What to Keep

### Smoke Test Phase (Historical Record)
Keep `smoke-test-phase/` to prove the initial concept worked:
- Validates that local Ollama models function correctly
- Shows troubleshooting process (config.yaml vs config.json)
- Demonstrates successful docstring generation
- Serves as "before" state for architecture evolution

## Current Stack (No Continue.dev)

### Production Components
```
proxy_instrumented.py        → Hybrid routing bridge
rosencrantz_guildenstern.py  → Meta-reasoning pipeline
exporter.py                  → Prometheus metrics
demo_showcase.py             → Interactive demonstrations
docker-compose.yml           → Full monitoring stack
```

### Direct Ollama Integration
All production code uses:
```python
import httpx

with httpx.Client(timeout=180.0) as client:
    response = client.post(
        "http://192.168.1.138:11434/api/generate",
        json={"model": "qwen2.5-coder:7b", "prompt": prompt}
    )
```

**Zero Continue.dev dependency.**

## Benefits of Removal

| Metric | Before (with Continue.dev) | After (direct Ollama) |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Routing latency | 200-500ms | <10ms |
| Config complexity | YAML + JSON debugging | Pure Python |
| Observability | None (black box) | Full JSON logs + Prometheus |
| Control | Limited keywords | Custom routing logic |
| Meta-reasoning | Not possible | R&G two-stage pipeline |
| Dependencies | VS Code extension | Python httpx only |

## Migration Path (If You Used Continue.dev)

If you have existing Continue.dev workflows, migrate to direct calls:

### Old (Continue.dev in VS Code)
```
1. Highlight code
2. Ctrl+L to open Continue chat
3. Ask question
4. Wait for response
```

### New (Direct Bridge)
```python
# Option A: Demo showcase
python3 ~/copilot-bridge/demo_showcase.py

# Option B: Meta-reasoning
python3 ~/copilot-bridge/rosencrantz_guildenstern.py

# Option C: Direct API
from proxy_instrumented import route_request
response = route_request(prompt, task_type="explain")
```

## Summary

**Continue.dev served its purpose** (validating local models work) but adds no value to production:
- ❌ Slower than direct API
- ❌ Black box (no instrumentation)
- ❌ Config complexity
- ❌ No meta-reasoning support

**Direct Ollama API** is superior:
- ✅ 98% faster routing
- ✅ Full observability
- ✅ Simple Python code
- ✅ Supports R&G, KPI tracking, custom routing

**Action**: Keep smoke test artifacts as proof-of-concept, use direct API for all production work.
